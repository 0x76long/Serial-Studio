This Commercial License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you (the "Licensee") and Alex Spataru (the "Licensor") governing the use of the official, precompiled versions of *Serial Studio* (the "Software").

## 1. Grant of License

Upon purchase of a valid Serial Studio license and successful activation, the Licensor grants you a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license** to use the Software for commercial purposes, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

This license **only covers the official precompiled binary**. It does **not** grant any rights to the source code, which remains under GPLv3 and separately licensed.

## 2. Permitted Uses

With a valid commercial license, you may:

- Use the Software internally in a business, corporate, or commercial setting.
- Use the Software as part of a proprietary workflow or internal system.
- Access and enable all paid features (e.g., MQTT, CANBus, XY plotting, etc.).
- Receive priority technical support (via email, GitHub issues, or optional video support).

### 2A. Personal and Evaluation Use (Without a Commercial License)

If you do not hold a valid commercial license, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use the official precompiled binary of the Software strictly for:

- **Personal, non-commercial use**, or
- **Short-term evaluation purposes**

Under this limited grant:

- Access to Pro features is disabled or restricted.
- You may not use the Software in any business, corporate, institutional, educational, or revenue-generating context.
- You may not integrate or deploy the Software within any system that is provided to third parties, clients, or customers.
- You may not use the Software as part of a workflow that contributes to a commercial product or service.

**This grant does not include any rights to redistribute, sublicense, or use the Software in any public-facing or monetized capacity.**

Violation of this section will be considered a breach of this Agreement and may result in termination of access, legal liability, and/or other enforcement actions as permitted by law.

## 3. Restrictions

Unless you receive **explicit, written permission** from the Licensor, you may **not**:

- Redistribute the Software in any form, modified or unmodified.
- Sublicense, sell, rent, lease, or relicense the Software.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to extract the source code.
- Integrate the Software into another product or service intended for resale.
- Use the Software to build or offer a competing product.

Violating these terms **automatically terminates** your license and may result in legal action.

## 4. Term & Termination

This Agreement remains in effect **as long as**:

- You maintain a valid paid license.
- You comply with the terms herein.

The Licensor may terminate this license immediately upon breach. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Software and delete all copies in your possession.

## 5. Ownership

The Software is licensed, not sold. The Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in the Software, including all intellectual property rights, regardless of the form of delivery.

You agree not to claim ownership, authorship, or misrepresent the origin of the Software.

## 6. Updates & Support

This license includes access to updates and bug fixes for the duration of the support term defined by the purchased license tier (e.g., 1 year of updates).

Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email or GitHub. Paid support tiers may include enhanced SLA or direct support channels.

## 7. Warranty Disclaimer

You assume full responsibility for any use of the Software and its outputs.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

> IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Total liability for any claims shall not exceed the license fee paid.
