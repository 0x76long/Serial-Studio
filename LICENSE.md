# Serial Studio License

Copyright &copy; 2020â€“2025 Alex Spataru <https://github.com/alex-spataru>  

All rights reserved where applicable.

Serial Studio is released under a **dual-license model**:

- The **GPLv3 license** applies to the *source code*.
- The **Commercial License** applies to all *official precompiled binaries*.

**The source code will always remain licensed under GPLv3.**

If you download a precompiled binary from the official website, GitHub Releases, or any other channel managed by the author (Alex Spataru), your usage is governed by the **Commercial License**, even if you do not activate the Pro features.

To use Serial Studio under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3), you must either **compile the source code yourself** using an open-source Qt setup, or install it via a package manager that explicitly distributes a GPL3-compliant build.

## GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)
You may use, modify, and redistribute the source code under the terms of the GNU GPLv3, as published by the Free Software Foundation.

Full license: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

**To use Serial Studio under GPLv3:**
- Build it yourself from source using a free/open-source Qt installation.
- Or install it from a trusted package manager that distributes GPLv3 builds.

### Highlights
- Full access to the source code.
- Use permitted for personal, academic, and commercial purposes under GPL terms.
- Must retain GPLv3 when redistributing or modifying.

### Limitations
- GPLv3 **does not apply** to official precompiled binaries.
- GPL builds **exclude** certain Pro-only features (see below).

## Commercial License
All official **precompiled binaries** (e.g., from [serial-studio.com](https://serial-studio.com), GitHub Releases, or other official channels managed by the author) are distributed under a **Commercial License Agreement**.

Downloading the binary **does not** grant you rights to use it in commercial or proprietary environments. You are **only granted commercial usage rights after purchasing a valid Pro license**.

Activation is required to unlock both the Pro features and the right to use the binary commercially.

Until a license is purchased and activated, use of the binary is limited to **personal and evaluation purposes only**.

### Commercial License Benefits
- Access to Pro features:
  - MQTT integration.
  - CANBus & Modbus decoding.
  - XY plotting & 3D visualization.
- Priority technical support (email, GitHub, optional video calls).
- Use in commercial or proprietary environments without GPL-related concerns.

## Scope of Use (with valid Pro license)
#### Permitted
- Internal use in commercial or enterprise environments.
- Embedding in proprietary workflows or customer-facing systems.

#### Restricted
- Redistribution, reverse engineering, or rebranding.
- Creating a competing product based on Serial Studio without written permission from the author.

If you require GPLv3 freedoms (including use without a commercial license),  
you must build the application from source using an open-source Qt installation,  
or use a GPL-compliant build provided by a trusted package manager.

## Not Allowed Without a Commercial License
- Embedding the official binary into a commercial or proprietary product.
- Using the official binary in corporate or enterprise environments.
- Offering the official binary as part of any paid service or commercial bundle.

## Permitted Under GPLv3 (Source-Only Use)
- Forking or modifying the code for personal, academic, or open-source projects.
- Embedding the GPL-compiled build into other open-source software.
- Using the GPL build in a commercial setting, **only if** you compiled it yourself  
  and fully comply with GPLv3 obligations.

You are free to use Serial Studio under the GPLv3 license, but only if you compile it yourself or use a GPL-compliant build from a trusted source.

**No support, warranty, or endorsement is provided by the author for unofficial or third-party builds. Use them at your own risk.**
