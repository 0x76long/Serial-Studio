## Commercial License

All official **precompiled binaries** (e.g., from [serial-studio.com](https://serial-studio.com),
GitHub Releases, or other official channels) are distributed under a
**Commercial License Agreement**.

> **:warning: Important:** Downloading the binary **does not** grant you rights to use it
> in commercial or proprietary environments.

You are **only granted commercial usage rights after purchasing a valid Pro license**.  
Activation is required to unlock both the Pro features and the right to use the binary commercially.

> Until a license is purchased and activated, use of the binary is limited to
> **personal and evaluation purposes only**.

### Commercial License Benefits
- Access to Pro features:
  - MQTT integration.
  - CANBus & Modbus decoding.
  - XY plotting & 3D visualization.
- No copyleft obligations on your own projects.
  (e.g., you're not required to open-source your product just because it uses Serial Studio)
- Priority technical support (email, GitHub, optional video calls).
- Use in commercial or proprietary environments without GPL-related concerns.

### Scope of Use (with valid Pro license)
- :white_check_mark: Permitted:
  - Internal use in commercial or enterprise environments.
  - Embedding in proprietary workflows or customer-facing systems.
- :x: Restricted:
  - Redistribution, reverse engineering, or rebranding.
  - Creating a competing product based on Serial Studio without written permission.

> [!NOTE]
> If you require GPLv3 freedoms (including use without a commercial license),
> you must build the application from source using an open-source Qt installation,
> or use a GPL-compliant build provided by a trusted package manager.
